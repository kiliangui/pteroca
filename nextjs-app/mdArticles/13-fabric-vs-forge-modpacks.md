## Fabric vs Forge modpacks: performance, compatibility, and choosing for your group

Both Fabric and Forge are excellent mod loaders—but they shine in different places. This guide compares them in plain terms so your group can pick the right foundation for your next HostChicken server.

### Quick summary

- Fabric: Lightweight, fast updates, modern performance mods, often smoother on modest hardware.
- Forge: Massive library, deep content mods, many classic packs and big tech/magic ecosystems.

### Ecosystem and mod availability

- Forge has been around longer and still hosts many flagship content mods.
- Fabric’s ecosystem has grown rapidly, especially for performance and QoL.
- Many mod authors publish on both, but complex content sometimes remains Forge‑only.

### Performance and updates

- Fabric tends to update quickly with new Minecraft versions.
- Performance mods like Lithium, Sodium (client), Starlight, and FerriteCore make Fabric packs feel snappy.
- Forge packs can run great too—just expect heavier RAM/CPU needs for big packs.

### Server management differences

- Both require matching loader versions on server and client.
- Updating Fabric packs between minor versions may be simpler.
- Forge’s large packs benefit from stricter version pinning and staging updates.

### Player experience

- Fabric: Great for modern, streamlined packs; faster UI, smoother chunks.
- Forge: Rich progression packs (tech/magic), complex machines, and massive quest lines.

### Choosing for your group

- Prefer Fabric if:
  - You want lighter packs and faster launch times
  - Your group’s PCs vary in power
  - You value quick updates and performance

- Prefer Forge if:
  - You want big‑name content mods and deep progression
  - Your players are comfortable with heavier packs
  - You have enough RAM/CPU to match

### Migration notes

- Fabric and Forge are not cross‑compatible. Switching loaders is effectively creating a new server.
- If you must switch, treat it as a new world or a carefully tested migration on a clone.

### Example pack ideas

- Fabric starter pack: Lithium, FerriteCore, + a few exploration/building mods; JEI/REI equivalent for recipes.
- Forge midweight: Create + QoL + JEI + JourneyMap; light on automation at first.
- Forge heavyweight: Create + Thermal + Immersive Engineering + quests; server RAM 6–8 GB+.

### Admin tips

- Always back up before updates.
- Pin versions once stable; don’t auto‑update everything.
- Profile performance regularly and trim heavy mods you don’t use.

### Bottom line

Pick Fabric for modern, efficient modpacks and Forge for large, content‑rich adventures. Either way, with backups, staging, and some basic performance tuning, you’ll have a smooth experience on HostChicken.
