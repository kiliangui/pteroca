## Manage your Minecraft server on mobile and desktop

Great servers thrive when they’re easy to manage. With HostChicken you can start, stop, and tune your world from your phone on the couch or your laptop at your desk. This guide shows you the exact workflows for day‑to‑day tasks so you can keep the fun going with as little friction as possible.

### Why manage from anywhere?

- Friends can play when you’re away: Wake the server from your phone and let them jump in.
- Quick fixes: Change view distance, restart, or roll back to a backup in minutes.
- Safety: Respond to griefing or crashes without waiting to get home.

### Sign in on any device

You can manage your server via the HostChicken mobile app or web dashboard on desktop. Log in with the same account and you’ll see the same list of servers and actions.

Tips for shared devices:

- Don’t save passwords on public computers.
- Enable two-factor authentication if available.
- Keep the app updated for security fixes and new features.

### Start, stop, and wake from hibernation

Servers can automatically hibernate when idle to save resources. Waking is simple:

1. Open the server page on mobile or desktop.
2. Tap Start (or Wake) to bring it online.
3. Share the address with your friends if it changed.

If wake-on-connect is enabled, the server will wake itself when someone tries to join. The first connection may take 30–60 seconds while the world loads.

### Check health at a glance

On both mobile and desktop you’ll see key health indicators:

- Status (online, offline, hibernating)
- Player count
- TPS (ticks per second) and performance indicators
- RAM and CPU usage

If TPS dips below 20 frequently, look for heavy farms, too many entities, or plugin/mod hotspots. Lower view/simulation distance slightly and test again.

### Tune performance quickly

For a smoother experience:

- View distance: 8–10 for general play, 6–8 for weaker devices or bigger groups.
- Simulation distance: 6–8 to limit mob/AI load.
- Max players: Keep realistic limits based on your server type and content.

Make one change at a time, play for 10–15 minutes, and watch TPS to verify impact.

### Add plugins or mods from desktop

While you can manage a lot from mobile, complex uploads are easier on desktop. The recommended flow:

1. Stop the server.
2. Take a manual backup.
3. For plugins (Paper/Spigot): Upload `.jar` files to the `plugins` folder.
4. For modpacks (Forge/Fabric): Upload the correct server pack (or use the built-in installer if available). Ensure versions match your client.
5. Start the server and watch the console for errors.

If you’re new to modpacks, start with a curated pack known to run well with your resources.

### Restore backups in a pinch

Stuff happens. Maybe a creeper chain reaction, a laggy farm gone wrong, or someone accidentally used `fill` on the wrong coordinates. Backups let you rewind safely:

1. Stop the server.
2. Open Backups and choose a restore point.
3. Confirm and wait for the restore to finish.
4. Start the server and verify.

Consider keeping 3–7 daily backups plus one “golden” milestone backup for major builds.

### Invite and moderate from mobile

You don’t need a desktop to keep your community safe.

- Whitelist: Add or remove players on the go.
- Roles and permissions (with plugins like LuckPerms): Promote helpers, demote troublemakers.
- Kicks and bans: Use sparingly, always communicate your rules first.

Set clear rules in your description: be kind, no griefing, and ask before changing shared builds. A friendly atmosphere keeps players coming back.

### Crash recovery playbook

If your server crashes or becomes unresponsive:

1. Stop the server and wait a moment.
2. Start it again and watch logs on desktop.
3. If it still fails, remove the last plugin/mod you added and try again.
4. Restore from a backup if the world is corrupted.
5. Investigate heavy farms or redstone that might be overwhelming the tick loop.

Document fixes so you can handle similar issues faster next time.

### Tips for smooth play sessions

- Coordinate version updates: Don’t update the server or client mid-session.
- Spread out heavy farms: Avoid stacking mega farms in one chunk.
- Use regions and claims: With WorldGuard and a claiming plugin, protect builds.
- Schedule quiet maintenance windows: Let friends know when restarts or updates happen.

### Desktop vs mobile: when to use each

Mobile is perfect for quick actions:

- Start/stop/wake
- Whitelist and permissions changes
- Kick/ban or warnings
- Minor setting tweaks

Desktop shines for heavy tasks:

- Uploading modpacks or many plugins
- Deep log review and profiling
- World editing and large backups

Use both depending on what your session needs. The goal is less waiting and more playing.

### Keep it fun and friendly

The best servers feel welcoming. Greet new players, celebrate builds, and plan group goals like community farms or a spawn town. Encourage collaboration between friends—shared projects keep people excited and invested.

With HostChicken you’re in control from wherever you are. Start the server before school, tweak settings on the bus home, and jump in with your friends when everyone’s ready. Managing your world should be simple—and now it is.
